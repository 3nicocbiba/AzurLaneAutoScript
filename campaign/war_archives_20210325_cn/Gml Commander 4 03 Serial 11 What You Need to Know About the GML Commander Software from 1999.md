# Gml Commander 4.03: A Digital Scale with Arduino
 
Gml Commander 4.03 is a software that allows you to control and calibrate a digital scale with Arduino. The scale uses a load cell and an HX711 amplifier to measure the weight of an object. The software communicates with the Arduino board via serial port and displays the weight on the screen. You can also adjust the calibration factor of the scale to get more accurate readings.
 
In this article, we will show you how to set up and use Gml Commander 4.03 with your Arduino scale. You will need the following components:

- An Arduino board (we used an Arduino Uno)
- A load cell (we used a 50 kg model)
- An HX711 amplifier module
- A breadboard and some jumper wires
- A USB cable to connect the Arduino to your computer
- Gml Commander 4.03 software (you can download it from [here](https://opesulreg.blogspot.com/?file=2syVT2))

First, you need to connect the load cell to the HX711 module. The load cell has four wires: red, black, white, and green. The HX711 module has two sets of pins: E+ (red), E- (black), A- (white), A+ (green), B- (white), B+ (green). Connect the wires from the load cell to the corresponding pins on the HX711 module as shown below:

Next, you need to connect the HX711 module to the Arduino board. The HX711 module has four pins: VCC, GND, DT, and SCK. Connect them to the Arduino board as follows:

- VCC to 5V
- GND to GND
- DT to digital pin 3
- SCK to digital pin 2

Now, you need to upload a sketch to your Arduino board that reads the data from the HX711 module and sends it to the serial port. You can use this code:
  ```c #include "HX711.h"  // HX711 circuit wiring const int LOADCELL_DOUT_PIN = 3; const int LOADCELL_SCK_PIN = 2;  HX711 scale;  void setup()    Serial.begin(9600);   scale.begin(LOADCELL_DOUT_PIN, LOADCELL_SCK_PIN);   void loop()     if (scale.is_ready())      long reading = scale.read();     Serial.println(reading);    else      Serial.println("Reading...");       delay(100);  ``` 
After uploading the code, open Gml Commander 4.03 on your computer and select the serial port that your Arduino is connected to. You should see a window like this:

The software will display the raw value from the HX711 module on the left side and the converted weight on the right side. You can change the units of measurement by clicking on the buttons below. You can also adjust the calibration factor by using the up and down arrows or typing a value in the box. The calibration factor is a number that determines how much weight corresponds to one unit of raw value. The higher the calibration factor, the lower the weight displayed.

To calibrate your scale, you need to place a known weight on the load cell and adjust the calibration factor until you get the correct reading. For example, if you place a 1 kg object on the scale and get a raw value of 100000, you can calculate the calibration factor as follows:
  $$calibration\\_factor = \fracraw\\_valueweight = \frac1000001 = 100000$$  
Then, you can enter this value in Gml Commander and see if it matches with your object's weight. You
